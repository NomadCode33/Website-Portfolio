My main focus was creating a clean, simple UI paired with a smooth, intuitive user experience.

## Optimizations
If I revisit this project, I’d love to add a night mode—ideally with a subtle starfall animation to bring the nighttime theme to life and make the interface feel more immersive.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned the importance of separation of concerns, which helped me keep my code organized, easier to maintain, and much simpler to update whenever I needed to fix errors or add new features.
